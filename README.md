Project Name: FlipValue
Team Name: iSALAJ Inc

## Project Summary:
As a reseller, it is difficult to resell items when we do not know how much an item is worth which results in improper pricing and profit loss. FlipValue is an app that uses AI to recognize brands, styles, and materials and then compares them to similar items. They will then suggest a fair resale price to the reseller/thrifter, which helps them make smarter decisions and selling their items efficiently.
